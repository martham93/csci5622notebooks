Next we need to show that $\\textrm{VCdim}(H) < 5$ by showing that **no** set of 5 points can be shattered by the union of a pair of intervals.  First, we can assume that none of the 5 points can lie on top of each other, since any labeling that assigned opposite labels to those two points could not be classified exactly.  Thus we can assume that the 5 points are distinct, and without loss of generality, order them as $x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5$.  Now consider the labeling $y_1 = +1, y_2 = -1, y_3 = +1, y_4 = -1,$ and $y_5 = +1$.  Now note that any interval that contains multiple points will be an incorrect labeling since the points alternate in label.  This then requires that we put intervals around individual positively labeled points, but there are three of them and we only have two intervals to burn, thus this labeling is impossible.   \n",
